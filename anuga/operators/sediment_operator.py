"""Fractional-step operator for suspended sediment transport and bed evolution.

Applies, once per timestep and after the hydrodynamic step:

    m_s  <-  m_s + dt (E_s - D_s)          [G-3] source term
    z    <-  z   + dt (D - E)/(1 - lambda) [G-4] Exner, suspended contribution

Both use the same limited source, so the sediment volume leaving suspension is
exactly `(1 - lambda) dz` and the mass budget closes by construction, whatever
timestepping method the flow algorithm uses.

The advective transport of `m` is NOT here: that lives in the flux kernel and
runs every substep with the rest of the shallow-water system. This operator
carries only the bed exchange.

GPU safety
----------
The work is done by `core_apply_sediment_source`, the same kernel in both
compute modes. In mode 2 it is called through the device path, so the tracer and
bed arrays are updated in place on the GPU with no host round trip. That matters
more than it looks: a fractional-step operator that writes on the host forces
`_gpu_host_writes_suppressed` on, which reactivates the sync bracket and drops
the whole run onto the host path -- a large, silent performance loss. This
operator must therefore stay on the GPU-safe list in
`Domain._has_cpu_only_fractional_operators`.

    """Suspended sediment transport and bed evolution, as a fractional step.

    Not normally constructed directly. The entry point is
    :meth:`~anuga.shallow_water.shallow_water_domain.Domain.initialize_sediment_operator`,
    which creates this operator and returns it, with
    :meth:`~anuga.shallow_water.shallow_water_domain.Domain.add_grain_size`
    for each grain size:

    .. code-block:: python

        domain.initialize_sediment_operator(porosity=0.28)
        domain.add_grain_size('sand', diameter=2.0e-4)
        domain.add_grain_size('silt', diameter=2.0e-5)

    Constructing it directly is equivalent to
    `domain.initialize_sediment_operator()` with no domain-wide parameters, and
    is there for code that wants the handle without setting anything.

    ONE OPERATOR PER DOMAIN. Constructing a second returns the first: the
    kernel makes a single pass over every registered grain size, so two
    operators in the fractional-step list would apply the bed exchange twice
    per timestep.
