"""Fractional-step operator for suspended sediment transport and bed evolution.

Applies, once per timestep and after the hydrodynamic step:

    m_s  <-  m_s + dt (E_s - D_s)          [G-3] source term
    z    <-  z   + dt (D - E)/(1 - lambda) [G-4] Exner, suspended contribution

Both use the same limited source, so the sediment volume leaving suspension is
exactly `(1 - lambda) dz` and the mass budget closes by construction, whatever
timestepping method the flow algorithm uses.

The advective transport of `m` is NOT here: that lives in the flux kernel and
runs every substep with the rest of the shallow-water system. This operator
carries only the bed exchange.

GPU safety
----------
The work is done by `core_apply_sediment_source`, the same kernel in both
compute modes. In mode 2 it is called through the device path, so the tracer and
bed arrays are updated in place on the GPU with no host round trip. That matters
more than it looks: a fractional-step operator that writes on the host forces
`_gpu_host_writes_suppressed` on, which reactivates the sync bracket and drops
the whole run onto the host path -- a large, silent performance loss. This
operator must therefore stay on the GPU-safe list in
`Domain._has_cpu_only_fractional_operators`.
