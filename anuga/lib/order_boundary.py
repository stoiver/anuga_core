'''Routine to automatically order boundary points'''

################################################################################
# This routine is used to automatically order boundary points in a CSV file.
#
# usage: order_boundary(infile, outfile)
#
# where infile  is the string path of the input CSV file,
#   and outfile is the string path of the output CSV file.
#
# The input file is expected to have the format:
#        longitude,latitude,index
#        150.0833,-37.5,2758
#        150.1,-37.4667,2765
#        150.1167,-37.3833,2769
#        150.1333,-36.7167,2771
#        150.1333,-36.7667,2774
#        150.15,-36.5833,2777
#        150.15,-36.6333,2780
#        150.15,-36.6833,2783
#        150.15,-36.8167,2787
#
# The first point in the ordered output file is assumed to be the first point in
# the input file (ie, line 2).  The header line is preserved, as are all fields
#following the first two fields in each data line.
