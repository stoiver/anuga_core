"""Method of Manufactured Solutions for the sediment source terms (RDy26 3.3).

MMS is the rigorous way to verify an implementation: prescribe a smooth exact
solution, derive the source term that makes it exact, then check the code
recovers it at the design order. Unlike the other sediment tests, a failure
here cannot be argued away -- the answer is known.

RDy26's own MMS takes its manufactured hydrodynamics from Bisht et al. (2025),
which is not to hand, so their case cannot be reproduced exactly. Their
manufactured SEDIMENT field is given in full (their B2-B5) and is used here:

    c_s(x,y,t) = C [1 + sin(Kx) sin(Ky)] exp(alpha_s t/T)
    K = pi/L,  L = 5 m,  T = 20 s,  C = 0.5,  alpha_1 = +1, alpha_2 = -1

Run in STILL WATER, so u = v = 0 and the advective term vanishes. That is
deliberate rather than a dodge: advection is already verified to machine
precision by the RDy26 dam-break contact test (test_sediment_rdycore.py, SSC
flat to 3.6e-15 across a rarefaction and a shock), while nothing else verifies
the SOURCE-TERM coupling and its order in time -- which is exactly what RDy26
say their MMS adds over the passive cases. The two together cover both halves
of [G-3].

With u = 0 the manufactured source reduces to

    m = h c,  dm/dt = h dc/dt,  E = 0 (no shear),  D = d* c v_s
    => S_ms = h dc/dt + d* c v_s

and the expected convergence is FIRST ORDER in dt: the source is applied as a
fractional step with the full timestep.
