"""An operator may invalidate the GPU interface mid-timestep.

apply_fractional_steps decides `gpu_mode` before running the operators, then
syncs the host-side work of any CPU-only operator back to the device
afterwards. An operator that calls set_tracer_source in between sets
domain.gpu_interface = None -- deliberately, since rebinding the source array
means the C struct and the device mapping must be rebuilt -- so that trailing
sync used to dereference None.

A manufactured-solution source does this on every step, which is how it was
found: the sediment MMS tests failed under ANUGA_DEFAULT_COMPUTE_MODE=unified
with 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'sync_to_device'.
