Description:
    This module contains a specialisation of class Generic_Domain from
    module generic_domain.py consisting of methods specific to the
    Shallow Water Wave Equation

    U_t + E_x + G_y = S

    where

    U = [w, uh, vh]
    E = [uh, u^2h + gh^2/2, uvh]
    G = [vh, uvh, v^2h + gh^2/2]
    S represents source terms forcing the system
    (e.g. gravity, friction, wind stress, ...)

    and _t, _x, _y denote the derivative with respect to t, x and y
    respectively.


    The quantities are

    """Build the mode-2 ('unified') startup banner as a list of lines.

    Pure function of its arguments so the rank/device mismatch warning can be tested
    without an actual multi-GPU machine.

    `numprocs` is the MPI rank count and `num_devices` the number of GPUs the runtime
    can actually see.  These are DIFFERENT NUMBERS, and the banner used to print the
    rank count labelled as "GPU(s)" — so a 4-rank run on a 1-GPU box cheerfully
    reported "4 GPU(s)".  That mattered because ranks are assigned to devices
    round-robin (``device_id = rank % num_devices``), so an oversubscribed run silently
    puts several ranks on one device.  The banner was the natural place to notice that,
    and instead it concealed it.  See issue #194.

    Why the warning is worded the way it is.  Measured on one RTX 5070, a 160k-triangle
    mode-2 evolve, ranks all sharing the single device:

        ranks   no MPS     with MPS
          1      3.80 s     3.51 s
          2      7.13 s     3.48 s
          4     11.21 s     3.72 s

    So the *reliable* cost of oversubscribing is speed: without MPS the ranks time-slice
    the device and it is ~3x slower.  NVIDIA MPS lets their kernels run concurrently and
    restores parity — but never beats one rank per GPU, because a single rank with the
    whole mesh already saturates the device; splitting it creates no new parallelism.
    So MPS is a way to stop losing, not a way to go faster.

    Hangs and garbled results have been reported in this configuration on real hardware,
    but did NOT reproduce in the runs above (every rank count gave a bit-identical
    checksum).  The warning therefore leads with the measured slowdown and reports the
    hangs as a possibility, rather than promising a failure that may not arrive — an
    oversubscribed run that quietly works but is 3x slow is the likelier outcome, and is
    exactly the one a user would otherwise never notice.

def set_gpu_offload(enable: bool = True, verbose: bool = True) -> bool:
    """Enable or disable GPU offload for mode-2 ('unified') domains, process-wide.

    This is a *process-level* switch, not per-domain: it affects every domain
    that runs in 'unified' mode, because OpenMP target offload is a process-wide
    runtime setting (one process cannot run the same unified kernels on a GPU for
    one domain and on the CPU for another).

    The setting is honoured at GPU-domain init, where arrays are mapped to the
    chosen device. **Call it before building the first 'unified' domain** — once
    a domain's data is mapped to a device, switching this domain's offload would
    leave data and execution on different devices.

    Implemented via the OpenMP default-device ICV (``omp_set_default_device`` /
    a process-global flag in ``sw_domain_gpu_ext``) — robust and re-enableable,
    unlike mutating ``OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD`` after the runtime has initialised.

    Parameters
    ----------
    enable : bool
        True to offload 'unified' domains to a GPU (GPU build + device required);
        False to force 'unified' to run CPU-multicore.

        Boyd culvert operators are handled via GPUCulvertManager (batched, only 2 GPU
        sync points) instead of the per-operator Python loop.

        Operator ORDER matters: fractional-step operators mutate `stage` in sequence, so
        running them in a different order gives different answers.  Mode 1 runs them in
        registration order.  Mode 2 must too, or the same script silently disagrees with
        itself across compute modes — and mode-1-vs-mode-2 agreement is the oracle we use
        to validate GPU work, so it must not depend on the order a user happened to
        construct their operators in.

        The batch is therefore fired **at the position of the first culvert in the list**,
        not before the loop.  When the culverts are registered together — which is what
        every real script does (towradgi registers 22 in a row) — that is *exactly*
        registration order, and the batching is untouched, so this costs nothing.

        gather/compute/scatter cycle, and there is no unbatched mode-2 culvert path).  We
