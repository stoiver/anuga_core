"""line_intersect selects by geometry, not by rounding (#231).

A triangle is selected when the segment passes through or along it with
positive length; a point contact (a vertex, or an edge touched from
outside at one point) is not a selection. Along a shared edge both
triangles are selected. The same answer must come out whichever way the
last bit of a coordinate fell, and from whichever compiler built the
extension.
