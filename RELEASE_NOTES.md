# ANUGA 4.1.0 (unreleased)

## Breaking changes

* **The legacy forcing-function classes have been removed**, as announced in
  4.0.0: `Rainfall`, `Inflow`, `Wind_stress`, `Wind_stress_fast`,
  `Barometric_pressure`, `Barometric_pressure_fast` and `General_forcing` are
  gone from `anuga.shallow_water.forcing`, and `anuga.Inflow`, `anuga.Rainfall`
  and `anuga.Wind_stress` are no longer exported. Use `Rate_operator.rainfall()`
  / `Rate_operator.inflow()`, `Wind_stress_operator` and
  `Barometric_pressure_operator`, which work in both compute modes. Note the
  rainfall units change from mm/s to mm/hr. See `UPGRADING_TO_4.0.md` §2.
  `Cross_section` stays in `anuga.shallow_water.forcing`.

## Selected fixes

* Inlet operators now carry tracers. `Inlet_operator` moved only water: an
  outlet (negative `Q`) took the water out and left its tracer behind, so
  the tracer concentrated without bound in the outlet cells as they drained,
  and an inflow always came in clean. Water removed now leaves at the inlet
  pool's mean concentration (the pool spans ranks in parallel), and water
  added carries `tracer_concentrations={'name': c or f(t)}`, zero by default
  as before. Both are exact, in both compute modes and in parallel; each
  operator keeps its running totals in `op.tracers.total_in` / `total_out`.
  Results change wherever tracers or sediment meet an extracting inlet.
* Structures carry tracers. Culverts, weirs, bridges and internal boundaries
  (`Boyd_box_operator`, `Boyd_pipe_operator`,
  `Weir_orifice_trapezoid_operator`, `Internal_boundary_operator`) moved
  water only, so the tracer stayed at the upstream end and clean water
  arrived downstream. Each cell that loses water now keeps its
  concentration, and the tracer it gives up arrives with the water, spread
  over the outflow cells in proportion to the water each gains: exact, and a
  structure that moves no water changes nothing. In both compute modes (the
  batched GPU culvert kernel included) and in parallel, where a culvert
  whose ends are on different ranks takes the host MPI path when tracers are
  present. Results change wherever a structure passes tracer or sediment.
* `Rate_operator` (and its `rainfall` / `inflow` factories) takes
  `tracer_concentrations={'name': c or f(t)}` for the water a positive rate
  adds, and `tracer_extraction='retain' | 'carry'` (or a dict per tracer)
  for what a negative rate does: `'retain'` leaves the tracer behind, the old
  behaviour and right for salt under evaporation; `'carry'` removes it with
  the water at the cell's concentration, as for a drain or pump. Exact per
  cell, in both compute modes. An operator with neither set behaves exactly
  as before and costs nothing extra.

* Structure operators (`Boyd_box_operator`, `Boyd_pipe_operator`,
  `Weir_orifice_trapezoid_operator`, `Internal_boundary_operator`) built their
  inlets from different regions depending on whether mpi4py was installed:
  the sequential class used the exchange line extended back by the apron,
  the parallel class (which the factory returns whenever mpi4py imports, on a
  serial domain too) computed the same polygon and then used the bare line
  (#367). Both now use the line plus apron, and the processors allocated to
  an inlet under MPI are chosen from that same region. Discharge and drained
  volume change for structure users whose install had mpi4py, by the apron's
  share of the exchange area.
* Line regions (`Region(line=...)`, `Set_quantity(line=...)`, the exchange
  lines of the structure operators, and the edges of an expanded polygon
  region) selected a compiler-dependent set of triangles when the line lay on
  mesh lines: the same script gave a 68% larger inlet area under one compiler
  than another (#231). The segment-triangle test is now tolerance-aware
  clipping with one rule: a triangle is selected when the segment passes
  through or along it with positive length, and not when it only touches a
  vertex or ends on an edge from outside. Selections change wherever a line
  touched triangles at a point: a 10 m exchange line on a 5 m mesh line now
  selects the 8 triangles along it rather than 32 (or 54), and an
  `Inlet_operator` line that passes through mesh vertices now feeds only the
  triangles it crosses, not every triangle meeting those vertices, so the
  same inflow enters over a smaller area and the local stage at the inlet
  is higher (the HEC-RAS bridge regression references were regenerated for
  this; the gauge agreement was unchanged). A zero-length segment, such as
  the side edges of a structure's apron polygon when `apron = 0`, selects
  nothing.
* Two runs writing the same SWW file used to interleave their frames on the
  shared time dimension, giving a file that opened fine and held plausible
  data with a non-monotonic time variable (#232). The writer now holds a
  sidecar `<name>.sww.lock` for the life of the run and a second run that
  would create the same file stops with `SWWFileInUseError`; stale locks from
  dead processes are taken over with a warning. It also refuses to append a
  frame earlier than the last one on file that rewrites no existing frame
  (`SWWTimeOrderError`); checkpoint resumes, which rewrite frames, still work.
* Sediment transport: the bed slope for the `'depth_slope'` shear closure
  (and the surface slope for `'energy_slope'`) is now the least-squares
  gradient of the centroid values over the cell and its neighbours. It was
  read from the edge values, which the DE algorithms rebuild every step
  through the hydrodynamic limiter: cells along a reflective wall saw no
  slope and never eroded, and the slope was reduced wherever the limiter
  engaged. Results change for those closures near boundaries, kinks and
  steps; `'quadratic_drag'` (the default) is unaffected.

## Smaller improvements

* A second non-cohesive entrainment law: de Leeuw et al. (2020),
  `set_bed_material('noncohesive', entrainment='de_leeuw')`, spec [E-6].
  `E* = A X^beta / (1 + 3 A X^beta)` with
  `X = (u*_skin / v_s)^alpha Fr - 0.015`, the skin-friction shear velocity
  from Manning-Strickler on a roughness `k_s`. Two constant sets:
  `de_leeuw_fit='de_leeuw_2020'` (their Eq 26a, sand and gravel) and
  `'nghiem_2022'`, as the Delta-X Wax Lake Delta sediment model uses it for
  mud as flocculated bed material load and for sand. Smith-McLean stays the
  default. Also in the TOML `[sediment]` table (`entrainment`,
  `de_leeuw_fit`, `skin_roughness`).

* Vegetation drag: `domain.set_vegetation_drag(density, diameter, height)`
  adds the drag of a stem field to the friction, with the vegetated Chezy
  coefficient of Baptist et al. (2007), emergent or submerged, applied
  semi-implicitly alongside Manning friction. The three fields are the
  quantities `veg_density`, `veg_diameter` and `veg_height`; cells with no
  stems are untouched. It runs in the friction kernel of both compute modes,
  so it offloads on a GPU build, which is what the Delta-X Wax Lake Delta
  model (1.5 million cells, a week of tides) needs to run in mode 2. See the
  vegetation page of the setup guide.
* `set_shear_closure()` takes two bounds for the slope closures:
  `max_slope` caps the per-cell slope (a stated replacement for anugaSed's
  undocumented global clamp), and `freeze_slope=True` (depth-slope only)
  takes the slope from the bed at setup and keeps it, so the anugaSed
  closure can run on an evolving bed without feeding on the roughness it
  creates. `Domain.bed_slope_magnitude()` returns the slope the kernel uses.
  Both are available from the TOML `[sediment]` table.
* Bedload has the Grass law, `set_bedload('grass', K=A_g)`: total load,
  `q_b = A_g |u|^(m-1) u` with `m` = 3, no threshold and no grain size, the
  law the classic Exner test cases are written in. And bedload can now pass
  through a boundary: `set_bedload(..., open_boundaries=('inflow',
  'outflow'))` makes the flux across those edges the cell's own `q_b . n`
  (zero gradient), so an outflow carries bedload away at the rate it arrives
  and an inflow supplies it at the rate the first cell removes it. Every
  boundary was closed before, so a reach's inflow cell exported bedload it
  never received and dug a hole that travelled downstream. Walls stay
  closed, and a closed domain is still exactly conservative. Both are in the
  TOML `[sediment]` table as `bedload = "grass"`, `bedload_K` and
  `bedload_open_boundaries`.
* The bedload edge flux now carries Rusanov dissipation scaled by a bound
  on the bed-wave speed, derived per formula. The bare centred flux was
  unstable on a migrating bed form: in the new bed-hump validation case it
  grew a scour hole at the upstream toe and an overshoot at the crest that
  fed back into the flow. The flux is still antisymmetric, so bedload is
  still exactly conservative, and the dissipation vanishes on a flat bed;
  results change wherever bedload moves a bed form. The bed update is
  applied in a pass of its own so that no cell reads a bed its neighbour
  has already changed.
* Four sediment validation cases join the automated suite under
  `validation_tests/analytical_exact/`: `sediment_erosion` (Smith-McLean
  entrainment on an evolving bed with the slope frozen, checked against the
  per-cell ODE), `sediment_settling_basin` (a settling basin with flow,
  whose steady concentration decays as `c0 exp(-x/L_s)` with
  `L_s = q/(d* v_s)`, checked cell by cell together with the bed-rise rate
  and the sediment budget between boundaries, water column and bed) and
  `sediment_equilibrium_flow` (clear water in normal flow on a Manning
  slope, where quadratic drag gives `tau_b = rho g h S` exactly, picking up
  its load as `c_eq (1 - exp(-x/L_s))`) and `sediment_bed_hump` (the
  Hudson-Sweby Exner test, a hump migrating under Grass bedload against its
  characteristic solution).
* A ready-made `anuga.Region` is accepted as `region=` by
  `Quantity.set_values()` (and so `Domain.set_quantity()` and friends), the
  erosion operators and `Set_w_uh_vh_operator`, alongside the existing
  polygon, circle and index forms, so one region definition serves every
  place it is needed (#15).
* The TOML scenario interface configures sediment transport: a `[sediment]`
  table for the domain-wide choices (porosity, bed evolution, shear closure,
  bed material, deposition law, friction mode, bedload, angle of repose,
  erodible base and regions) and `[[sediment.fractions]]` entries for the
  grain fractions, with inflow concentrations per boundary tag. Validated
  like the other sections, applied by `setup_sediment` in the generated run
  script, counted in the scenario summary.
* GeoPackage in and out (#39, #40): `gpkg2polygons()` / `polygons2gpkg()`
  read and write polygon and polyline layers with attributes and a CRS as
  the `[x, y]` lists ANUGA's regions, buildings and breaklines take, and
  `polygon_csv_files2gpkg()` / `gpkg2polygon_csv_files()` and
  `building_csv2gpkg()` / `gpkg2building_csv()` convert the two CSV
  conventions ANUGA already reads. Needs `fiona` and `shapely`
  (`anuga[data]`), imported only on call.
* `Domain.get_water_volume()` and `compute_total_volume()` take `region=` (an
  `anuga.Region`) or `indices=` to sum the water in part of the domain, as
  `Quantity.get_integral()` already did (#22). Regional queries do not enter
  `volume_history`.
* `Wind_stress_operator` and `Barometric_pressure_operator` accept
  `use_coordinates=False` with a `file_function`, replacing the file-driven
  wind and pressure fields of the removed `_fast` classes. The file's
  precomputed time series is interpolated for every point at once
  (`anuga.utilities.function_utils.evaluate_file_function_all_points`).

# ANUGA 4.0.0

First release on the 4.x line, and the first release of the work that has been
accumulating on `develop` since 3.3.10 — 993 commits across 935 files.

The headline is a **GPU/multicore solver**: the shallow-water kernels now run
through a single unified C implementation that executes on the CPU or offloads
to a GPU, with mode-1 and mode-2 agreeing bit-for-bit on the paths that matter.
Alongside that are a decade-old correctness fix in the structure operators, a
substantial set of parallel and wet/dry fixes, and container images.

**Existing scripts keep working.** The default compute mode is unchanged
(`'legacy'`), and both the unified mode and GPU offload are opt-in. What makes this a major version is the
removal of long-deprecated code, not a change in day-to-day behaviour.

---

## Highlights

### The unified compute mode

The solver and its operators now have a single C implementation that runs
CPU-multicore, and can offload to a GPU on a suitably built install.

```python
domain.set_compute_mode('unified')     # per domain; CPU-multicore by default
```

or process-wide with `ANUGA_DEFAULT_COMPUTE_MODE=unified`.

* **No GPU required.** 'unified' is a compute mode, not a GPU switch: on an
  ordinary build it runs the same unified C kernels on the CPU. GPU offload is a
  separate, process-wide opt-in — `anuga.set_gpu_offload(True)` on a build made
  with the NVIDIA HPC SDK. `gpu_offload_supported()` reports whether a build can.
* **One implementation of the physics.** `culvert_compute_one()` is shared by
  both paths, so 'legacy' and 'unified' give bit-identical culvert results.
* On GPU: fluxes, extrapolation, boundaries, riverwalls, culverts and operators
  all execute on device, with multi-GPU via MPI and device-side halo exchange.
* New controls: `set_gpu_offload()`, `gpu_offload_enabled()`,
  `gpu_offload_supported()`, `set_omp_num_threads()`, `get_omp_num_threads()`.

`set_multiprocessor_mode(1|2)` still works as a thin wrapper, but
`set_compute_mode('legacy'|'unified')` is the preferred API for new code.

### New timestepping method

* **`DE_ader2`** — a fused ADER-2 predictor/extrapolation step, measured **1.75×
  faster than DE1** at equivalent accuracy. Select with
  `domain.set_flow_algorithm('DE_ader2')`.

### Rainfall and forcing

* `Raster_rate_operator` — apply gridded rainfall rasters directly.
* Australian Rainfall & Runoff support: `ARR_rate_operator`, `Arr_hub_rain`,
  `Arr_ifd_rain`, `ARR_point_rainfall_patterns`, `Arr_grd`.
* `Wind_stress_operator` and `Barometric_pressure_operator` — operator
  equivalents of the legacy forcing classes (see Deprecations).

### Boundaries

* `Absorbing_wave_boundary` and `Characteristic_wave_boundary`.

### Meshes and memory

* `sequential_mesh_dump` / `sequential_mesh_load` — partition once, run many
  scenarios; NetCDF, self-describing, safe to share.
* `uniform_refine_domain`, `sequential_mesh_refine`, `create_parallel_mesh`.
* ~58% reduction in quantity memory; `quantity_memory_stats()`,
  `domain_memory_stats()` to inspect it.

### Tooling

* Container images: CPU, GPU (NVHPC/nvc), and GPU+CUDA-aware-MPI, published to
  GHCR on release.
* GUIs: `anuga_sww_gui`, `anuga_animate_gui`.
* `anuga_toml_run` for the TOML scenario interface (which itself shipped in
  3.3.x; new here are `[[mesh.interior_holes]]` and `[[erosion]]` sections).
* `anuga_run_isolated_tests` — per-test process isolation, needed on GPU builds.

---

## Breaking changes

* **`anuga.culvert_flows` is removed** (7 790 lines). It was superseded years ago.
  Migrate to the structure operators — `Boyd_box_operator`, `Boyd_pipe_operator`,
  `Weir_orifice_trapezoid_operator`. `examples/structures/run_open_slot_wide_bridge.py`
  shows the equivalent setup.
* **Local-timestepping attributes removed**: `max_flux_update_frequency`,
  `flux_update_frequency`, `update_next_flux`, `update_extrapolation`,
  `edge_timestep`, `allow_timestep_increase`. The 3.1.9 implementation was not
  GPU-compatible and had been dead code; see `claude/FUTURE_WORK.md` P3.1 for the
  redesign.
* **Structure operators now write back a level water surface** (see below). This
  changes results for any structure whose inlet sits on a sloping bed.

### The structure write-back change (#229)

Structure operators wrote their transfer back as a **uniform depth** across each
inlet. On a sloping bed that tilts a level water surface onto the bed, so a lake
at rest was disturbed by roughly half the bed elevation range across the inlet —
every timestep, at zero discharge.

The write-back now applies the volume change by **levelling the stage** (water
finds its level), clamping cells at their bed.

What to expect:

| case | change |
|---|---|
| flat bed under the inlet | **none** — bit-identical by construction |
| sloping bed | results move; magnitude scales with the bed range across the inlet |

Measured on the Towradgi catchment (22 culverts on real terrain, inlet bed
spread median 0.77 m): peak stage difference **0.32 m**, 99th percentile 1.5 mm.
Three of four flat-bed validation cases were bit-identical.

If you calibrated a model against pre-4.0.0 results with structures on sloping
ground, re-check it.

---

## Deprecations

The legacy forcing classes in `anuga.shallow_water.forcing` now all emit
`DeprecationWarning` and **will be removed in 4.1**:

| deprecated | use instead |
|---|---|
| `Rainfall` | `Rate_operator.rainfall()` |
| `Inflow` | `Rate_operator.inflow()` |
| `Wind_stress`, `Wind_stress_fast` | `Wind_stress_operator` |
| `Barometric_pressure`, `Barometric_pressure_fast` | `Barometric_pressure_operator` |

These are **silently skipped** in the `'unified'` compute mode, which applies
forcing in C and handles only Manning friction; a warning is issued when that
happens. Migrating to the operators is required to use them with 'unified'.

`manning_friction_semi_implicit` is *not* deprecated — it is an in-step
semi-implicit term, not an operator.

---

## Selected fixes

* **Parallel inlet mass balance** (#193) and **startup mass loss** (#200) — both
  affected conserved volume in ordinary runs.
* **Culvert stack overflow** with more than 64 culverts (#217) — buffers were
  sized by a constant that was only the initial capacity.
* **GPU culvert inlet cap** (#225) — an inlet was limited to 64 triangles.
* **Riverwall crest changes reach the device** (#224) — runtime
  `set_elevation()` was silently ignored under GPU offload.
* **DE0 non-GPU boundary fallback** — Euler steps silently ignored
  Python-evaluated boundary types in the 'unified' mode.
* Degenerate-timestep protection now warns rather than silently not running
  in the 'unified' mode (#189).

---

## Smaller improvements

* Importing anuga from an unbuilt source tree now explains itself. It used to
  fail with a bare `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'anuga._version'`,
  which pointed at neither cause: `_version.py` is generated at build time, and
  because Python searches the working directory first, an unbuilt tree also
  shadows a correctly installed anuga whenever you run from the repository
  root. The error now names the directory it imported from and says how to fix
  it (#237).

## Requirements

* Python 3.10 – 3.14, numpy ≥ 2.0
* GPU offload requires the NVIDIA HPC SDK (`nvc`); the standard build is
  unaffected and needs no GPU.

## Known issues

* Windows CI pins the conda-forge mingw sysroot chain to build 10. Build 11
  (2026-08-20) produces a toolchain whose binaries abort in the stack protector;
  tracked at conda-forge/m2w64-sysroot-feedstock#23. This pins only the CI
  environment — released wheels are unaffected.
* A structure sitting in near-still water amplifies roundoff; see
  `claude/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`.
