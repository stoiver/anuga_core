"""Example 4 -- a sand dune overtopped, with and without slope collapse.

Erosion on its own will cut a vertical face. Real sand cannot stand at 90
degrees: once scour oversteepens it, the face collapses and the material runs
out over the toe. Spec 7 relaxation is what puts that back in.

This runs the SAME overtopping event twice, once with relaxation off and once
with it on, and compares the bed it leaves behind. The comparison is the
example; either run alone would tell you very little.

Demonstrates
  * domain.set_angle_of_repose(), and what it changes
  * that the collapse CONSERVES MASS -- the material that leaves the face
    arrives at the toe, rather than vanishing
  * the sweep count and the cap report, which is the part of this that
    surprises people
  * how to read a slope field back out of a domain

The scenario follows the sanddune operator's: a dune line overtopped by a wave,
where the concern is how much of the dune survives. The physics underneath is
different -- this is a sediment mass balance, that is a kinematic erosion rule
-- and the mass budget below is the difference made visible.
