=====================================
Running Scenarios with anuga_run_toml
=====================================

.. currentmodule:: anuga

The ``anuga_run_toml`` script provides a ready-made runner for ANUGA flood and
tsunami scenarios.  All simulation inputs are described in a single
`TOML <https://toml.io>`_ configuration file — no Python coding required for
standard setups.  The same script also accepts legacy Excel (``.xlsx``) files
from the older ``cairns_excel`` interface.

.. contents:: Contents
   :local:
   :depth: 2


Quick Start
-----------

**Serial run:**

.. code-block:: bash

   anuga_run_toml  path/to/scenario.toml

**Parallel run (MPI):**

.. code-block:: bash

   mpirun -np 6  anuga_run_toml  path/to/scenario.toml

All relative paths inside the TOML file are resolved relative to the directory
that contains the TOML file, so the script can be invoked from any working
directory.


Working example — Cairns tsunami scenario
------------------------------------------

A complete, ready-to-run example is provided in
``examples/run_toml/cairns/`` of the repository.  It models a synthetic
tsunami entering Cairns Harbour (Queensland, Australia) and exercises most
TOML features: a shapefile boundary, a DEM elevation raster, Flather open-
ocean boundaries, and one each of a bridge, pumping station, culvert, and weir.
The (≈9 MB) DEM is shared under ``examples/data/cairns/``.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd examples/run_toml/cairns
   anuga_run_toml cairns_example.toml          # serial
   mpirun -np 4 anuga_run_toml cairns_example.toml   # parallel

The same scenario is also available through a legacy Excel front-end under
``examples/cairns_toml_excel/`` (see *Excel Compatibility* below).


Minimal annotated TOML
-----------------------

The snippet below is the smallest valid TOML that will run a real simulation.
Copy it, adjust the file paths, and add extra sections as needed.

section below.


Scenario Directory Layout
--------------------------

A typical scenario directory looks like this::

   my_scenario/
   ├── scenario.toml          ← main configuration file
   ├── user_functions.py      ← optional custom callbacks (see below)
   ├── mesh/
   │   ├── boundary.shp       ← domain boundary shapefile (or .csv)
   │   └── ...
   ├── boundarycond/
   │   ├── tide.csv
   │   └── ...
   └── initialcond/
       └── dem.asc

On completion, outputs are written to a timestamped subdirectory under
``output_base_directory`` (e.g. ``OUTPUT/RUN_20260315_120000_scenario/``).
A copy of all code files — including the TOML config and the runner script
itself — is archived there for reproducibility.


Configuration File Reference

The TOML file is divided into sections (TOML *tables*).  Every key shown
without a comment is **required**; keys shown with a ``# default:`` comment

   # Domain boundary file — two formats are supported:

   # Riverwall CSV files — like breaklines but each row has three columns:
   #   x [m], y [m], crest_elevation [m]
   # An optional first line may contain hydraulic parameters, e.g.:

**Interior regions** (polygon-based resolution refinement):

.. code-block:: toml

   [[mesh.interior_regions]]
   polygon    = "mesh/fine_region.csv"
   resolution = 10000.0   # maximum triangle area [m²]

Interior regions and ``region_areas_file`` / breaklines are mutually exclusive.

**Explicit boundary tags** (required when ``bounding_polygon`` is a CSV):

.. code-block:: toml

   [[mesh.boundary_tags]]
   tag   = "ocean"
   edges = [0, 1]

   [[mesh.boundary_tags]]
   tag   = "land"
   edges = [2, 3]

Edge indices are 0-based and refer to the segments between consecutive polygon
vertices.

.. _toml-boundary:

[boundary_conditions]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One ``[[boundary_conditions.boundaries]]`` entry is required for every tag
that appears in the bounding polygon.

.. code-block:: toml

   [boundary_conditions]

   # Shapefile attribute name that carries the boundary tag.
   # Must match the attribute used in the boundary shapefile.
   boundary_tags_attribute_name = "Boundary"

   # Reflective (solid wall) boundary — no file needed
   [[boundary_conditions.boundaries]]
   tag  = "Land"

   # Stage boundary — transmissive with prescribed stage timeseries
   [[boundary_conditions.boundaries]]
   tag        = "Ocean"
   type       = "Stage"
   file       = "boundarycond/tide.csv"   # columns: time_s, stage_m
   start_time = 0.0                       # subtract from CSV times [s]

   # Flather radiation boundary with prescribed stage timeseries
   [[boundary_conditions.boundaries]]

   type       = "Flather_Stage"
   file       = "boundarycond/tide.csv"
   start_time = 0.0

.. _toml-initial:

[initial_conditions]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each quantity is built from an ordered list of ``[[initial_conditions.<qty>]]``
entries.  Earlier entries take priority over later ones.

Supported quantities: ``elevation``, ``friction``, ``stage``, ``xmomentum``,
``ymomentum``.

Each quantity also supports an optional spatial-averaging step controlled by
a ``{qty}_spatial_average`` key at the ``[initial_conditions]`` level.
When set, the quantity field is averaged onto a regular grid at the given
spacing (metres) before being applied to the mesh — useful for smoothing
noisy DEMs or variable-resolution friction fields:

.. code-block:: toml

   [initial_conditions]
   elevation_spatial_average  = 100.0   # smooth DEM at 100 m grid
   friction_spatial_average   = 50.0    # smooth friction at  50 m grid
   # stage_spatial_average    = 50.0    # also valid for stage, xmomentum, ymomentum

   [[initial_conditions.elevation]]
   polygon  = "Extent"                    # apply over full raster extent
   value    = "initialcond/dem.asc"       # GDAL-compatible raster
   clip_min = -inf
   clip_max = inf

   [[initial_conditions.elevation]]
   polygon  = "All"                       # catch-all fallback
   value    = 0.0
   clip_min = -inf
   clip_max = inf

   [[initial_conditions.friction]]
   polygon  = "mesh/mannings_zone.csv"    # apply inside polygon
   value    = 0.025
   clip_min = 0.01
   clip_max = 0.5

   [[initial_conditions.friction]]
   polygon  = "All"
   value    = 0.03
   clip_min = 0.01
   clip_max = 0.5

**Polygon options:**

===============  ==============================================================
``"Extent"``     Apply over the full spatial extent of the raster ``value``
``"All"``        Apply everywhere (use as the final catch-all entry)
``"None"``       Skip this entry
path to file     ``.shp`` or ``.csv`` polygon
===============  ==============================================================

**Value options:**

====================  =========================================================
constant number       applied uniformly across the polygon
path to raster        GDAL-compatible raster (``.asc``, ``.tif``, …)
path to CSV/TXT       file with columns ``x``, ``y``, ``z``
====================  =========================================================

.. _toml-additions:

[initial_condition_additions]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Same structure as ``[initial_conditions]``, but values are *added on top of*
whatever was set there.  Useful for local offsets such as a pre-dredged
channel, a localised initial flood pool, or a small friction adjustment.

.. code-block:: toml

   [initial_condition_additions]

   [[initial_condition_additions.elevation]]
   polygon  = "mesh/dredge_channel.csv"
   value    = -2.0
   clip_min = -inf
   clip_max = inf

.. _toml-inlets:

[[inlets]]
~~~~~~~~~~

Line sources / sinks of discharge across a cross-section.

.. code-block:: toml

   [[inlets]]
   name            = "river_inflow"
   line_file       = "mesh/river_line.csv"       # cross-section polyline
   timeseries_file = "boundarycond/river_flow.csv"  # columns: time_s, discharge_m3s
   start_time      = 0.0

Positive discharge adds water; negative removes it.  Multiple ``[[inlets]]``
entries are supported.

.. _toml-rainfall:

[[rainfall]]
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Spatially uniform rainfall rate over a region.

.. code-block:: toml

   [[rainfall]]
   timeseries_file    = "boundarycond/rain.csv"  # columns: time_s, rate_mm_per_hr
   start_time         = 0.0
   interpolation_type = "linear"                 # "linear" or "nearest"
   polygon            = "All"                    # path to CSV polygon, or "All"
   multiplier         = 1.0                      # scale factor (default 1.0)

Multiple ``[[rainfall]]`` entries are supported.

.. _toml-bridges:

[[bridges]]
~~~~~~~~~~~

HEC-RAS rating-curve internal boundary operator.  Set ``enabled = false`` to
disable a bridge without removing its definition.

.. code-block:: toml

   [[bridges]]
   enabled                      = true
   label                        = "bridge_1"
   deck_file                    = "mesh/bridge1_deck.csv"
   deck_elevation               = 4.5         # [m] bed elevation forced inside deck polygon
   exchange_line_0              = "mesh/bridge1_exchange_up.csv"
   exchange_line_1              = "mesh/bridge1_exchange_down.csv"
   enquiry_gap                  = 2.0         # [m] from exchange lines to enquiry points
   internal_boundary_curve_file = "mesh/bridge1_rating_curve.csv"
   vertical_datum_offset        = 0.0         # [m] added to curve elevations
   smoothing_timescale          = 20.0        # [s] exponential smoothing constant

.. _toml-culverts:

[[culverts]]
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Box or pipe culverts using the Boyd (1987) head-discharge algorithm.
Set ``enabled = false`` to disable without removing the definition.

``type`` selects the cross-section shape:

* ``"boyd_box"``  — rectangular barrel (``width`` × ``height``).
* ``"boyd_pipe"`` — circular barrel (``diameter``).

**Geometry** — choose exactly one of:

* ``exchange_line_0`` / ``exchange_line_1``: paths to CSV polyline files
  that define the upstream and downstream exchange zones.  The exchange
  zone widths govern how much of the mesh perimeter couples to the culvert.
  This is the preferred approach for field models.

* ``end_point_0`` / ``end_point_1``: ``[x, y]`` coordinate pairs for the
  two barrel ends.  ANUGA derives short perpendicular exchange lines
  automatically.

**Boyd box example:**

.. code-block:: toml

   [[culverts]]
   enabled              = true
   type                 = "boyd_box"

   losses               = 0.5             # head-loss coefficient (0.5 = sharp-edge inlet)
   barrels              = 1.0             # number of parallel identical barrels
   blockage             = 0.0             # fractional blockage [0,1]; 0 = fully open
   z1                   = 0.0             # batter slope at end 0 (rise/run)
   z2                   = 0.0             # batter slope at end 1
   apron                = 0.1             # [m] flat apron at each end
   manning              = 0.013           # barrel Manning's n
   smoothing_timescale  = 0.0             # [s] exponential smoothing constant
   use_momentum_jet     = true
   use_velocity_head    = true
   # invert_elevations  = [1.0, 0.8]      # [m] upstream, downstream; sampled from DEM if omitted

**Boyd pipe example:**

   [[culverts]]
   enabled              = true
   type                 = "boyd_pipe"
   label                = "drain_pipe_1"
   diameter             = 0.6              # [m] internal barrel diameter

   losses               = 0.5
   barrels              = 2.0              # two parallel pipes
   manning              = 0.013
   smoothing_timescale  = 0.0

   type        = "boyd_box"
   label       = "simple_culvert"
   width       = 0.9

   losses      = 0.5

Multiple ``[[culverts]]`` entries are supported.


.. _toml-weirs:

[[weirs]]
~~~~~~~~~

Weir / orifice structures with a trapezoidal cross-section, using combined
weir and orifice flow formulae (``Weir_orifice_trapezoid_operator``).
Set ``enabled = false`` to disable without removing the definition.

Geometry is specified with the same ``exchange_line_0`` / ``exchange_line_1``
(file paths) or ``end_point_0`` / ``end_point_1`` (coordinates) choice as for

[[pumping_stations]]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pump operator transferring water between a wet-well basin and a discharge
point.  Set ``enabled = false`` to disable without removing the definition.

Input Validation
-----------------

The TOML parser validates all required fields and value ranges before the
simulation starts.  Errors are collected and reported together so you can
fix all problems in a single pass rather than re-running after each one.

A missing required field or an out-of-range value produces a message like::

   TOML configuration errors in 'scenario.toml':
     [project] 'scenario' is required but missing
     [project] 'flow_algorithm' must be one of ('DE0', 'DE1') — got 'de0'
     culverts['road_culvert_1'] 'width' must be > 0 — got -0.9

The run aborts after reporting all errors.


Custom Callbacks: user_functions.py
-------------------------------------

Place a file called ``user_functions.py`` alongside the TOML file to add
custom per-timestep actions.  The runner imports it automatically; if the file
is absent it is silently skipped.

Two hooks are called when the corresponding TOML flags are ``true``:

``print_velocity_statistics(domain, max_quantities)``
   Called when ``report_peak_velocity_statistics = true``.
   Receives the live domain and the
   :class:`~anuga.operators.collect_max_quantities_operator.Collect_max_quantities_operator`
   instance.

``print_operator_inputs(domain)``
   Called when ``report_operator_statistics = true``.
   Receives the live domain; useful for printing rainfall rates, inlet
   discharges, etc.

A minimal example:

.. code-block:: python

   # user_functions.py
   from anuga.parallel import myid, barrier

   def print_velocity_statistics(domain, max_quantities):
       if myid == 0:
           import numpy as np
           xx = domain.quantities['xmomentum'].centroid_values
           yy = domain.quantities['ymomentum'].centroid_values
           dd = domain.quantities['stage'].centroid_values \
               - domain.quantities['elevation'].centroid_values
           dd = np.maximum(dd, 1.0e-3)
           speed = np.sqrt(xx**2 + yy**2) / dd
           print(f'  Peak speed: {speed.max():.3f} m/s')

   def print_operator_inputs(domain):
       if myid == 0:
           for op in domain.fractional_step_operators:
               if hasattr(op, 'applied_Q'):
                   print(f'  {op.label}: Q = {op.applied_Q:.3f} m³/s')


Output Directory Structure
---------------------------

Each run creates a timestamped directory under ``output_base_directory``::

   OUTPUT/
   └── RUN_20260315_120000_scenario/
       ├── scenario.sww           ← NetCDF output (stage, momentum, elevation)
       ├── Simulation_logfile.log ← full stdout log
       ├── Max_quantities_*.csv   ← peak stage, depth, speed per triangle
       ├── *.tif                  ← GeoTiff rasters of peak quantities
       ├── code/                  ← archived copy of all input files
       │   ├── scenario.toml
       │   ├── anuga_run_toml     ← copy of the runner script
       │   └── user_functions.py
       └── SPATIAL_TEXT/          ← text copies of spatial inputs (for QC)


Excel Compatibility
--------------------

``anuga_run_toml`` also accepts legacy Excel files::

   anuga_run_toml  path/to/ANUGA_setup.xlsx

The Excel format is described in the ``cairns_toml_excel`` example directory.
Attributes that exist only in the TOML interface
(``multiprocessor_mode``, ``omp_num_threads``, ``outputstep``,
``report_operator_statistics``) are set to sensible defaults when reading
Excel files.
