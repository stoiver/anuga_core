Operators
=========

Operators are objects that modify domain quantities each timestep.  They are
attached to a :class:`Domain` and called automatically during the evolve loop.
All operators accept a *region* (polygon, centre+radius, or explicit triangle
indices) so that their effect can be restricted to a spatial subset of the
mesh.

   * - Operator
     - What it does
     - Typical use case
   * - :class:`Rate_operator`
     - Adds or removes water at a specified volumetric rate per unit area
       (m s⁻¹). Rate can be a constant, a function of ``(t)``,
       ``(x, y)``, or ``(x, y, t)``, or a quantity/array.
     - Rainfall, evaporation, infiltration, or a prescribed source/sink
       over a catchment polygon.
   * - :class:`Inlet_operator`
     - Injects a prescribed discharge (m³ s⁻¹) into a region, with
       optional velocity direction.  More physically meaningful than
       ``Rate_operator`` when the total flow rate (not areal rate) is known.
     - Pump outlets, stormwater inlets, river inflows with a known
       hydrograph.
   * - :class:`Set_quantity_operator`
     - Overrides any named quantity to a given value (constant, function of
       time, or array) each timestep over a region.
     - Pinning stage or friction to a prescribed value in a localised area.
   * - :class:`Set_stage_operator`
     - Sets water stage over a region each timestep, enforcing
       stage ≥ elevation.  Equivalent to ``Set_quantity_operator`` for
       ``'stage'`` with the wet-floor guard.
     - Maintaining a constant or time-varying water level in a reservoir or
       tidal basin.
   * - :class:`Set_elevation_operator`
     - Updates bed elevation over a region each timestep while maintaining
       flow continuity (adjusts stage so depth is preserved).
     - Moving boundaries, sediment deposition/erosion, or a gate that
       changes bed level during the simulation.
   * - :class:`Boyd_box_operator`
     - Models flow through a rectangular box culvert between two exchange
       regions using the Boyd head-discharge algorithm.  Accounts for inlet
       losses, Manning friction, and free/submerged flow states.
     - Road culverts, drainage pipes with rectangular cross-section.
   * - :class:`Boyd_pipe_operator`
     - Same as :class:`Boyd_box_operator` but for circular pipes
       (diameter instead of width × height).
     - Round drainage pipes and stormwater culverts.
   * - :class:`Weir_orifice_trapezoid_operator`
     - Models flow over or through a trapezoidal weir/orifice structure,
       switching between weir and orifice flow regimes automatically.
     - Spillways, broad-crested weirs, and trapezoidal channel structures.
   * - :class:`Internal_boundary_operator`
     - General user-defined structure: the discharge Q is computed by a
       Python function ``f(hw, tw)`` of headwater and tailwater stage.
       Positive Q flows from headwater to tailwater.
     - Non-standard hydraulic structures where no standard Boyd formula
       applies — e.g. tide gates, sluice gates with custom rating curves.
   * - :class:`Kinematic_viscosity_operator`
     - Applies a parabolic smoothing step that diffuses the depth-averaged
       velocity field according to ``du/dt = div(h ∇u)``.  Acts as a
       numerical stability aid for very fine meshes or sharp fronts.
     - Stabilising simulations with strong velocity gradients or sharp wet/
       dry fronts where spurious oscillations appear.


Rate Operators
--------------

:class:`Rate_operator` adds or removes water over a region each timestep.
The rate is in m s⁻¹ (volume per unit area per second); positive values add
water, negative values remove it.

.. code-block:: python

    import anuga

    # Uniform rainfall of 10 mm/hr over a polygon
    rainfall_rate = 10e-3 / 3600.0   # m/s

    rain_polygon = [[0, 0], [100, 0], [100, 100], [0, 100]]
    rain = anuga.Rate_operator(domain, rate=rainfall_rate, polygon=rain_polygon)

Time-varying rate:

.. code-block:: python

    def storm(t):
        """20 mm/hr for the first hour, then dry."""
        if t < 3600:
            return 20e-3 / 3600.0
        return 0.0

    rain = anuga.Rate_operator(domain, rate=storm, polygon=rain_polygon)

.. autosummary::

   Rate_operator


Inlet and Outlet Operators
---------------------------

:class:`Inlet_operator` injects a total discharge Q (m³ s⁻¹) into a region.
It is more convenient than :class:`Rate_operator` when the flow rate is known
rather than the areal rate.

.. code-block:: python

    import anuga
    import math

    # Inflow region — a circle of radius 5 m centred at (50, 50)
    inflow_region = anuga.Region(domain, center=[50.0, 50.0], radius=5.0)

    # Sinusoidal hydrograph peaking at 2 m³/s
    inflow = anuga.Inlet_operator(
        domain,
        inflow_region,
        Q=lambda t: max(0.0, 2.0 * math.sin(math.pi * t / 3600.0)),
    )

.. autosummary::

   Inlet_operator


Setting Operators
-----------------

These operators overwrite a quantity each timestep.  They are useful for
maintaining prescribed conditions inside the domain (e.g. a reservoir with a
fixed level, or a moving bed).

.. code-block:: python

    import anuga

    reservoir = [[200, 300], [200, 400], [300, 400], [300, 300]]

    # Hold stage at 10.5 m in the reservoir polygon
    stage_ctrl = anuga.Set_stage_operator(domain, stage=10.5, polygon=reservoir)

    # Raise the bed by 0.01 m/hr (e.g. sediment deposition)
    t0 = 0.0
    initial_elev = 5.0
    deposition = anuga.Set_elevation_operator(
        domain,
        elevation=lambda t: initial_elev + 0.01 / 3600.0 * t,
        polygon=reservoir,
    )

   Set_quantity_operator

Culvert and Bridge Operators
-----------------------------

Culvert operators model flow between two exchange regions through a
hydraulic structure.  They are specified by two ``end_points`` (or
``exchange_lines``) that define the upstream and downstream faces.

.. code-block:: python

    import anuga

    # Rectangular box culvert: 1.2 m wide × 0.9 m high
    culvert = anuga.Boyd_box_operator(
        domain,
        losses=1.5,
        width=1.2,
        height=0.9,
        end_points=[[10.0, 5.0], [15.0, 5.0]],
        manning=0.013,
        verbose=False,
    )

    # Circular pipe culvert: 0.6 m diameter
    pipe = anuga.Boyd_pipe_operator(
        domain,
        losses=1.5,
        diameter=0.6,
        end_points=[[30.0, 5.0], [35.0, 5.0]],
        manning=0.013,
    )

    # Custom structure with a user-defined rating curve
    def gate_flow(hw, tw):
        """Simple orifice equation — positive Q flows hw→tw."""
        delta_h = max(hw - tw, 0.0)
        return 2.5 * delta_h ** 0.5

    gate = anuga.Internal_boundary_operator(
        domain,
        gate_flow,
        end_points=[[50.0, 5.0], [55.0, 5.0]],
    )

Collecting Maximum Quantities
------------------------------

.. method:: Domain.set_collect_max_quantities(update_frequency=1, collection_start_time=0., velocity_zero_height=None, store_to_sww=True)
   :noindex:

During a simulation it is often useful to record the highest water depth, speed,
momentum, and stage that each cell ever reached — for flood mapping, hazard
assessment, or post-processing without replaying every timestep.

:meth:`Domain.set_collect_max_quantities` attaches a
:class:`Collect_max_quantities_operator` to the domain that accumulates these
running maxima as the simulation evolves.  Call it **once before the evolve
loop**; it returns the operator so you can query or export results afterwards.

**Minimal usage**

.. code-block:: python

    import anuga

    domain = anuga.rectangular_cross_domain(20, 10)
    domain.set_quantity('elevation', lambda x, y: x / 50.0)
    domain.set_quantity('stage', expression='elevation + 0.5')
    domain.set_boundary({'exterior': anuga.Reflective_boundary(domain)})

    op = domain.set_collect_max_quantities()   # store_to_sww=True by default

    for t in domain.evolve(yieldstep=10.0, finaltime=120.0):
        pass

    # After the run, per-centroid numpy arrays are available on the operator:
    print(op.max_stage.max())   # highest stage anywhere in the domain
    print(op.max_depth.max())   # maximum inundation depth
    print(op.max_speed.max())   # maximum flow speed
    print(op.max_uh.max())      # maximum momentum magnitude ||(uh, vh)||

    op.export_max_quantities_to_csv()   # writes Max_Quantities_P0_X_Y_Stage_Depth_Speed_UH_MAX.csv

**Parameters**

``update_frequency`` : int, default 1
    Update the running maxima every this many inner timesteps.  Increasing this
    value trades accuracy for speed in very long simulations; ``1`` (default)
    updates every timestep and is recommended for most uses.

``collection_start_time`` : float, default 0.0
    Only start collecting after this simulation time (seconds).  Useful for
    skipping an initial spin-up period that should not contribute to the maxima.

``velocity_zero_height`` : float or None, default None
    Treat cells shallower than this depth (metres) as dry and assign them zero
    speed.  Defaults to ``domain.minimum_allowed_height``.

``store_to_sww`` : bool, default True
    Write the running maxima to the SWW output file as centroid-only quantities
    (``max_stage_c``, ``max_depth_c``, ``max_speed_c``, ``max_uh_c``) at every
    yield step.  This means the final SWW file holds the end-of-simulation
    maxima, which can be visualised directly in ANUGA Viewer without a full
    timestep scan.  Set to ``False`` if the SWW file size is a concern.

**Accessing results**

After (or during) the evolve loop the operator exposes four NumPy arrays, one
value per mesh triangle centroid:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Attribute
     - Description
   * - ``op.max_stage``
     - Maximum absolute water surface elevation (m)
   * - ``op.max_depth``
     - Maximum water depth above bed (m); never negative
   * - ``op.max_speed``
     - Maximum flow speed = \|momentum\| / depth (m s⁻¹), wet cells only
   * - ``op.max_uh``
     - Maximum momentum magnitude \|\|(uh, vh)\|\| (m² s⁻¹)

``op.export_max_quantities_to_csv()`` writes these arrays (plus XY
coordinates) to a CSV file named
``Max_Quantities_P<rank>_X_Y_Stage_Depth_Speed_UH_MAX.csv``.

**Skipping a spin-up period**

.. code-block:: python

    # Collect maxima only after the first hour of simulation
    op = domain.set_collect_max_quantities(collection_start_time=3600.0)

**Reducing overhead on long runs**

.. code-block:: python

    # Update every 5 timesteps instead of every timestep
    op = domain.set_collect_max_quantities(update_frequency=5)

**SWW output and ANUGA Viewer**

When ``store_to_sww=True`` (the default), ANUGA Viewer reads the pre-computed
``max_stage_c`` / ``max_depth_c`` / ``max_speed_c`` / ``max_uh_c`` variables
directly from the SWW file, bypassing the full timestep scan it would otherwise
need.  The four ``Max …`` display modes (accessed with the :kbd:`v` key) all
work without any extra steps.

**Parallel runs and** ``sww_merge_parallel``

When running with MPI, each rank independently tracks maxima for its own
triangles.  The four centroid quantities are written to each rank's SWW file
with the correct ``tri_l2g`` indexing and are automatically assembled into the
correct global positions by :func:`sww_merge_parallel`:

.. code-block:: python

    # After an MPI run that produced domain_P4_0.sww … domain_P4_3.sww:
    import anuga
    anuga.sww_merge(domain_global_name='domain', np=4)
    # The merged domain.sww contains max_stage_c, max_depth_c,
    # max_speed_c, and max_uh_c for the complete global mesh.
