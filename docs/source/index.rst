===================
ANUGA documentation
===================

ANUGA (pronounced "AHnooGAH") is open-source software for the simulation of the 
shallow water equation, 
in particular it can be used to model tsunamis and floods.

ANUGA is a Python 3 package (Python 3.10 – 3.14) with some C and Cython
extensions.

ANUGA was created in a collaboration by Geoscience Australia 
and Mathematical Sciences Institute at the Australian National University. 
It is now developed and maintained by a community of volunteers.

.. note::

   The main documentation (**Contents**) covers the standard workflow most users
   need: install ANUGA, try an example, write a script (or use the TOML scenario
   interface), run it, view the results, and parallelise if needed. The
   **Appendices** hold advanced topics — the developer and GPU installs, advanced
   parallel methods, compute modes and GPU offloading, and advanced scripting.
