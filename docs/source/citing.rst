Citing ANUGA
============

If you use ANUGA in published work, please cite it.

Software
--------

Cite the ANUGA software using the metadata in the repository's ``CITATION.cff``
file — GitHub's **"Cite this repository"** button (top right of the
`repository page <https://github.com/anuga-community/anuga_core>`_) generates an
up-to-date APA or BibTeX entry from it. A minimal BibTeX entry:

.. code-block:: bibtex

   @software{anuga,
     title     = {ANUGA Hydrodynamic Inundation Modelling},
     author    = {Roberts, Stephen and Davies, Gareth and Nielsen, Ole and others},
     publisher = {Australian National University and Geoscience Australia},
     url       = {https://github.com/anuga-community/anuga_core}
   }

ANUGA was created by Geoscience Australia and the Mathematical Sciences Institute
at the Australian National University, and is now maintained by a community of
volunteers.

Key publications
----------------

Two papers describe the method ANUGA implements, and are the usual citations for
the model itself. The first develops the finite-volume solution of the
two-dimensional shallow water equations on unstructured triangular meshes that
ANUGA is built on; the second describes its application to coastal inundation:

  reservoirs in urban areas. *Journal of Hydraulic Engineering*, 125(7),
  686–695. https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(1999)125:7(686)
