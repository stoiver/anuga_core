#
# Install ANUGA with GPU offloading support using the NVIDIA HPC SDK (nvc).
#
# Run this script as follows:
#
#   bash /path/to/anuga_core/tools/install_anuga_nvc.sh
#
# The script locates nvc in the NVIDIA HPC SDK, activates the conda
# environment, and builds the GPU-enabled anuga package.
#
# Environment variables (all optional):
#
#   PY          Python version to use (default: 3.12, matching
#               install_miniforge.sh).  Ignored when a conda environment is
#               already activated -- that one is used.
#   GPU_ARCH    GPU compute capability, e.g. cc120 (RTX 5070 Blackwell),
#               cc86 (RTX 30xx Ampere), cc90 (H100), cc80 (A100), cc70 (V100).
#               Default: DETECTED from the GPU in this machine via nvidia-smi,
#               falling back to a multi-architecture build if that fails.
#               Getting this wrong matters: the build now contains only the
#               architectures asked for, so a mismatched value produces a
#               package that compiles fine and then crashes on every kernel
#               launch.
#   NVHPC_ROOT  Override path to NVIDIA HPC SDK root if auto-detection fails.
#               e.g. /opt/nvidia/hpc_sdk/Linux_x86_64/26.3
#
# Example — build for an A100 with Python 3.13:
#
#   PY=3.13 GPU_ARCH=cc80 bash /path/to/anuga_core/tools/install_anuga_nvc.sh
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - NVIDIA HPC SDK installed (see KNOWN_ISSUES.md for apt install recipe)
#   - conda environment anuga_env_${PY} created via install_miniforge.sh

# Keep this default in step with tools/install_miniforge.sh: the documented flow
# is to run that script and then this one, and if the two disagree this one
# looks for an environment the other never created.
