## Build

### Building with GPU offloading (NVIDIA HPC SDK / nvc)

ANUGA's GPU extension (`sw_domain_gpu_ext`, `multiprocessor_mode=2`) requires
`nvc` from the NVIDIA HPC SDK — GCC 15's nvptx backend ICEs on `core_kernels.c`
(ompdevlow GIMPLE pass segfault in `core_extrapolate_second_order_edge`).

**One-time setup (Ubuntu, requires sudo):**
```bash
# Add NVIDIA HPC SDK apt repo
curl -fsSL https://developer.download.nvidia.com/hpc-sdk/ubuntu/DEB-GPG-KEY-NVIDIA-HPC-SDK \
  | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-hpcsdk-archive-keyring.gpg
echo 'deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-hpcsdk-archive-keyring.gpg] https://developer.download.nvidia.com/hpc-sdk/ubuntu/amd64 /' \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvhpc.list
sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get install -y nvhpc   # ~5 GB
```

**GPU build (RTX 5070 = Blackwell cc120; adjust gpu_arch for other GPUs):**
```bash
NVC=/opt/nvidia/hpc_sdk/Linux_x86_64/26.3/compilers/bin/nvc
conda run -n anuga_env_3.14 bash -c "CC=$NVC pip install --no-build-isolation -v -e . \
  -Csetup-args=-Dgpu_offload=true \
  -Csetup-args=-Dgpu_arch=cc120"
```

Meson auto-detects nvc as `nvidia_hpc`; the build uses `-mp=gpu,multicore -gpu=cc120`.
The build dir must be clean if switching from a prior GCC build (`rm -rf build/cp314`).

**Verify GPU works:**
```bash
conda run -n anuga_env_3.14 pytest anuga/shallow_water/tests/test_DE_gpu_omp.py -v
```
All 56 tests pass on the RTX 5070.

**Switching back to CPU-only build:**
```bash
rm -rf build/cp314
conda run -n anuga_env_3.14 pip install --no-build-isolation -e .
```

### `--no-build-isolation` is recommended

`pip install --no-build-isolation -e .` is the recommended build approach.
It is not strictly required in all environments, but is preferred because
it ensures meson-python uses the Cython/numpy already installed in the conda
environment rather than fetching isolated build dependencies.

### Generated C files appear as untracked in `git status`

`sw_domain_openmp_ext.c` and other generated `.c` files are listed in
`.gitignore` but still show up as untracked. This is expected — they are
build artifacts.

---

## Testing

### `str.find()` returns 0 for first-position match (2026-03-26)

In `anuga/pmesh/mesh.py::_generateMesh_impl`, the old check `not self.mode.find('Q')`
was buggy: `str.find()` returns 0 when 'Q' is at position 0, and `not 0` is `True`,
so the check was treating a 'Q' at position 0 as "not found". Fixed by using
`'Q' not in self.mode`.

### Triangle library prints to stdout during pytest

The triangle C library writes to stdout when in verbose mode ('V' flag). Since
pytest `-s` does not suppress stdout, these appear as noise during test runs.
Fixed by ensuring `_generateMesh_impl` adds 'Q' (quiet) when `verbose=False`.

### `test_verbose_does_not_raise` triggers logging output

`anuga/abstract_2d_finite_volumes/tests/test_pmesh_to_mesh.py::test_verbose_does_not_raise`
intentionally calls with `verbose=True`. This triggers `General_mesh:` log output.
Fixed by wrapping with `logging.disable(logging.CRITICAL)` / `logging.disable(logging.NOTSET)`.

### Parallel tests run as subprocesses

Tests in `anuga/parallel/tests/` spawn `mpiexec` subprocesses. They cannot be
parallelised with `pytest-xdist` and must run serially. They are marked slow
and skipped by `--run-fast`.

### Targeted `--cov=anuga.submodule` runs corrupt numpy's `_NoValue` sentinel

Running `pytest --cov=anuga.structures.structure_operator` (or any sub-package
path) causes test failures with:
```
TypeError: float() argument must be a string or a real number, not '_NoValueType'
```

**Root cause:** coverage.py calls `importlib.util.find_spec('anuga.structures.structure_operator')`
inside a `sys_modules_saved()` context (in `inorout.py`). This auto-imports parent
packages (including `anuga/__init__.py` → `shallow_water_domain.py` → numpy),
then purges all newly-imported modules from `sys.modules`. The subsequent real
import re-executes `numpy/__init__.py`. Since numpy's C extension (`_multiarray_umath`)
was already initialized, the reload guard fires and a new `_NoValue` singleton is
created — but C extensions hold references to the old one, breaking identity checks.

**Workaround:** Always use `--cov=anuga` (not a sub-path). For per-module numbers:
```bash
pytest --run-fast --cov=anuga anuga/structures/tests/ -q 2>&1 | grep structure_operator
```

**Not fixable** from conftest.py: pytest-cov creates `CovPlugin` (which starts
coverage) inside `pytest_load_initial_conftests(tryfirst=True)` — before conftest.py
is even loaded.

## Numerical

### `== None` vs `is None` with numpy arrays

Using `== None` on a numpy array raises `ValueError: The truth value of an array
is ambiguous`. Always use `is None` / `is not None` throughout the codebase.

### `epsilon = 1.0e-6` wet/dry threshold

`anuga/config.py` defines `epsilon` as the wet/dry threshold. Many conditional
checks use `depth > epsilon` rather than `depth > 0`. Be aware of this when
writing new flux/operator code.

### `minimum_allowed_height = 1.0e-05`

Cells below this height are treated as dry. Negative depths are clipped.

---

## API

### `numpy` imported as `num` (not `np`)

This is a project-wide convention — do not change it to `np` in existing files.

### `anuga/__init__.py` is the single public API surface

All public names must be both imported and listed in `__all__` in `anuga/__init__.py`.
The file is ~1000 lines; search carefully before adding to avoid duplicates.

### camelCase methods in `pmesh/mesh.py` are deprecated

As of 2026-03-24, camelCase public methods have snake_case equivalents.
The camelCase versions emit `DeprecationWarning`. Prefer snake_case in new code.

### `get_CFL` / `set_CFL` are deprecated in `generic_domain.py`

Use `get_cfl()` / `set_cfl()` instead.

---

## Memory and Performance

### `psutil` is optional

`anuga/utilities/system_tools.py::memory_stats()` tries `psutil` first and falls
back to parsing `/proc/self/status` via `_VmB('VmRSS:')`. If neither works it
returns `'mem=?'`. The `psutil` package is not in the conda environment files
by default.

### Kinematic viscosity operator is slow

`test_kinematic_viscosity_operator.py` runs 4 tests that take 2–5 seconds each.
These are marked `@pytest.mark.slow` at module level.

---

## Structures

### `RiverWall` tests require full mesh with breaklines

`anuga/structures/riverwall.py` — tests were deferred because `RiverWall`
requires a domain with a mesh that has breaklines (specific mesh construction).
Simple rectangular domains don't suffice.

### Mode-2 ('unified') riverwall flux diverges from legacy (2026-06-15)

A riverwall simulation run under `multiprocessor_mode=2` produces a **different**
result from `multiprocessor_mode=1` (legacy). On `run_parallel_riverwall.py`
(sequential), stage diverges progressively from 0 at t=0 to ~0.095 m by
t≈100 s (mean ~0.006 m). All the riverwall data is correctly wired into the
GPU domain (`edge_flux_type`, `riverwall_elevation`, `edge_river_wall_counter`,
hydraulic properties — see `sw_domain_gpu_ext.pyx` `get_domain_pointers`), and
the GPU flux kernel (`core_compute_fluxes_central` in `gpu/core_kernels.c`) does
implement the riverwall elevation override + Villemonte weir correction. The
divergence is a subtle numerical mismatch between the GPU and legacy
(`sw_domain_openmp_ext`) riverwall flux/extrapolation paths — not a missing
feature — and has **not** yet been root-caused.

**Implication / workaround:** mode-2 + riverwalls is not a validated path. The
non-riverwall solver is bit-identical between modes; riverwalls are the
exception. `anuga/parallel/tests/run_parallel_riverwall.py` pins
`set_compute_mode('legacy')` so the seq-vs-parallel equivalence test stays
meaningful even when the suite runs with `ANUGA_DEFAULT_COMPUTE_MODE=unified`.
Fixing the kernel and adding a dedicated mode-2 riverwall equivalence test is
tracked in `claude/FUTURE_WORK.md`.

## SWW GUI / animate.py

### `replace_all=True` in Edit tool can change more than intended

When reverting a colormap from `terrain` → `Greys_r` with `replace_all=True`, the `_elev_frame` and `save_elev_frame` default arguments (which must stay `terrain`) were also reverted — requiring a second manual fix. Always check every occurrence of the target string in the file before using `replace_all`.

### Worker must accept all params even when a save method doesn't use them

`worker_frame` in `_animate_worker.py` calls `save_fn(frame=..., show_elev=..., elev_levels=..., show_mesh=...)` for every quantity. If a `save_*` method (e.g. `save_elev_frame`) doesn't declare those params, it raises `TypeError`. All `save_*` methods must accept `show_elev`, `elev_levels`, `show_mesh` even if they ignore the values.

### Double overlays when baked + canvas overlay both active

If Show Elev or Show Mesh is ticked during generation (baked into PNGs) and the canvas overlay is also active, contours/mesh appear twice. The canvas overlay methods check `self._last_gen_show_elev` / `self._last_gen_show_mesh` and return early when already baked. This guard must be maintained if either system is extended.

### Live mesh viewer redraw requires `ax.cla()` + full re-draw

When toggling the Basemap checkbox in `_show_mesh`, a simple `ax.set_visible()` or artist removal is not sufficient — the basemap tiles are added by `contextily` as Axes-level patches. The only reliable approach is `ax.cla()` (clear axis), re-draw the triplot, conditionally call `_add_basemap`, call `mesh_fig.tight_layout()`, then `mesh_canvas.draw()`.

---

## Scenario Module

### `anuga/scenario/` depends on `spatialInputUtil`

The scenario module (`prepare_data.py`, `setup_boundary_conditions.py`, etc.)
imports `spatialInputUtil`, a compiled C extension not included in the main repo.
Meaningful unit tests require this extension plus real shapefile/Excel test data.
Tests for this module are deferred.

---

## Hydrata Current-State Assessment (2026-02-28)

These are known issues identified in the Hydrata fork analysis that also apply to anuga-community.

### `pyproject.toml` declares only `numpy` as a dependency

Despite the codebase importing scipy, netCDF4, matplotlib, meshpy, dill, pymetis, pyproj,
and affine, `pyproject.toml` only lists `numpy>=2.0.0`. This means `pip install anuga`
on a clean venv will produce a package that fails at runtime.

**Fix:** Add the missing dependencies to `[project].dependencies`.

### Phantom dependencies: `cartopy` and `openpyxl`

These appear in code paths but are never actually imported at runtime. Their presence in
any install documentation is misleading.

### GDAL remnants on `remove-gdal` branch

GDAL was partially removed but remnants remain. The `remove-gdal` branch has the work
in progress. Merge not yet complete in anuga-community.

### `setup.py` still present alongside meson-python

Both `setup.py` and `pyproject.toml` (meson-python) exist. The `setup.py` is a
legacy artifact and should be removed once meson-only builds are confirmed in CI.

### Test isolation problems

- **47 `set_datadir('.')` calls** — many tests write files relative to CWD rather than
  a temp directory. Running tests from a non-repo directory can fail or pollute the tree.
- **198 `tempfile.mktemp()` uses** — `mktemp()` is a security risk (TOCTOU) and deprecated.
  Should be replaced with `tmp_path` fixture (pytest) or `tempfile.mkdtemp()`.
- **7+ tests write `domain.sww` to CWD** — parallel test runs step on each other.

### Code duplication (~7,700 redundant lines)

- Three quantity kernels share ~90% code: `quantity_ext.pyx`, `quantity_ext_openmp.pyx`, `quantity_ext2.pyx`
- Five parallel operator wrappers are near-identical to their `structures/` counterparts
- `Culvert_operator` and `Culvert_operator_Parallel` have near-identical logic
- `system_tools.py` is 750 lines with overlap against `numerical_tools.py`

### No linting or type annotations

Zero pre-commit hooks, no ruff/flake8 config, 4,189 functions with no type annotations.
Current approach is manual `pyflakes` / `autopep8` before commits.

### GPU build forced to CPU (`set_gpu_offload(False)` / `-ngo`) is slow — nvc limitation

A `gpu_offload=true` (nvc `-mp=gpu,multicore`) build forced onto the host runs the
`omp target teams distribute` regions through nvc's host fallback, which **does not
scale with threads** (it gets *slower* with more threads). Microbenchmark (40M-element
memory-bound loop, 60 iters, RTX 5070 box, HPC SDK 26.3):

| config | 1t | 8t | 16t |
|--------|----|----|-----|
| nvc `-mp=gpu,multicore` + `OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=disabled` | 0.91s | 4.48s | 3.00s (pathological) |
| nvc `-mp=multicore` (multicore-only build) | 0.92s | 0.73s | 0.64s |
| gcc `-fopenmp` (`#pragma omp parallel for`) | 0.92s | 0.76s | 0.61s |
| nvc GPU offload | — | — | 0.12s |

Neither `OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=disabled` nor `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=` engages the good
multicore variant of the dual build — the host always gets the GPU variant's serial-ish
fallback. towradgi small (256k tri, -ft 200 -ys 50) confirms it: GPU 6.35s, `-ngo`
60–100s (1.7× scaling 1→16 threads), vs a gcc `gpu_offload=false` build at ~17s.

**Implication:** a GPU build is not a substitute for a CPU build. `set_gpu_offload(False)` /
`-ngo` is for **correctness A/B** (verify GPU and CPU give identical results — they are
bit-identical) only, NOT timing. For CPU-multicore performance, build with
`-Dgpu_offload=false` (gcc → host-optimised `omp parallel for` via the `CPU_ONLY_MODE`
macros). `set_gpu_offload(False)` warns about this on a GPU build.

**This is a confirmed, documented NVHPC limitation, not an ANUGA bug** (investigated
2026-06-13). The NVHPC Reference Guide defines `-mp=gpu` as "compiled for GPU execution
*as well as host fallback to the CPU*" — and that host fallback runs **single-threaded**.
A peer-reviewed compiler comparison (IPDPSW 2023, Iowa State) measured NVHPC host fallback
at "OMP 1" (1 CPU thread) and found "the GPU code version on CPU in host fallback mode
performs worse than the CPU version with 1 thread". NVHPC is also documented to handle
nested/inner parallel regions poorly (NVIDIA recommends the `loop` directive over
`teams distribute parallel for` for this reason). The fast multicore variant only exists
when `-mp=multicore` is the *sole* mode; `-mp=gpu,multicore` does not let the runtime pick
it on the host (verified across `OMP_TARGET_OFFLOAD=disabled`, `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=`,
argument order, and `ACC_DEVICE_TYPE` — the last hangs). So a single nvc binary cannot be
fast on both GPU and CPU; the two-build split (gcc CPU / nvc GPU) is required.
