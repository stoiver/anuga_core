# Static analysis of ANUGA's hand-written C sources with gcc -fanalyzer
# (audit issue #342). Run from the repository root:
#
#     bash scripts/c_static_analysis.sh            # analyse, fail on any finding
#     bash scripts/c_static_analysis.sh --list     # just list the files it would analyse
#     CC=gcc-13 bash scripts/c_static_analysis.sh  # a specific gcc (CI pins one; see lint.yml)
#
# Different gcc versions report different things, so a finding that only one
# version raises is normal: fix it if it is real, or add it to EXCLUDE below
# with a note if it is not.
#
# Every *.c under anuga/ that is not a Cython-generated *_ext.c is compiled to
# /dev/null with -fanalyzer and the include paths meson uses. Findings inside
# third-party headers (uthash.h) are filtered out. Anything else fails the
# script, so a new unchecked malloc, leak on an error path, or NULL
# dereference is caught before review. Needs gcc >= 12 and numpy importable
# from the python on PATH.
